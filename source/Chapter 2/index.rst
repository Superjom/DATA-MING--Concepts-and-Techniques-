mean::
    
    average value

median::
    
    middle value

mode::
    
    most common value

These are measures of **central tendency**, which give us an idea of the "middle" or center of distribution.

Knowing such basic statistics regarding each attribute makes it easier to fill in missing values, smooth noisy values, and spot outliers during data preprocessing.
