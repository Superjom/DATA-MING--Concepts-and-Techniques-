1.7 Major Inssues in Data Mining
******************************************
researchers have been vigorously developing new methodologies . 

this involves:

* the investigation of new kinds of knowledge
* mining in multidimensional space
* integrating methods from other disciplines
* consideraton of semantic ties among data objects

1.7.1 Mining Methodology
--------------------------

Mining various and new kinds of knowledge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mining knowledge in multidimensional space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In many cases, data can be aggregated or viewed as a multidimensional data cube.

Mining knowledge in cube space can substantially enhance the power and flexibility of data mining.

Data mining--an interdisciplinary effort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The power of data mining can be substantially enhanced by integrating new methods from multiple disciplines.

For example, to mine data with natural language text, it makes sense to fuse data mining methods with methods of information retrieval and natural language processing.

Handling uncertainty, noise, or incompleteness of data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Errors and noise may confuse the data mining process, leading to the derivation of erroneous patterns.

1.7.2 User Interaction

1.7.3 Efficiency and Scalability
------------------------------------

Efficiency and scalability of data mining algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Data mining algorithms must be efficient and scalable in order to effectively extract information from huge amounts of data in many data repositories or in dynamic data streams

Parallel, distributed, and incremental mining algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
incremental data mining::
    
    incorporates new data updates without having to mine the entire data "from scratch"
    such methods perform knowledge modification incrementally to amend and strengthen what was previously discovered.
