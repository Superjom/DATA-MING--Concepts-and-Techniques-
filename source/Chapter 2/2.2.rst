2.2.1 Measuring the Central Tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*to offset the effect caused by a small number of extreme values, we can instead use the* **trimmed mean**.

trimmed mean::
    
    the mean obtained after chopping off values at the high and low extremes.
    For example, we can sort the values observed for salary and remove the top
    and bottom 2% before computing the mean.
